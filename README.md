# PDFtoAudio
Application that allows User to upload a pdf file, convert it to mp3 and save it.

User Interface built with TkInter
Processing PDF files with PyPDF2 library
Text to speech conversion with pyttsx3 library

### What I learned / used for the first time:
Combining functionalities of different libraries to one application
Usage of PyPDF2 and pyttsx3 libraries
Positioning widgets in TKinter with the help of column weight and setting the padding in the .grid (before I used empty Labels as a workaround)
Using TKinter filedialog and messagebox for cleaner code (before I would code out the popup window, resulting in more code lines)
